- Hi, I’m Brian Kim
- I’m interested in Filling this in, and also wondering why i need to go to college 許さない
- I’m currently learning how to fit in with earthlings
- I'm originally from Tralfamadore
- I'm a (Junior and a half) in Computer Engineering
- I chose my major because initially I used to reprogram pokemon games and had a lot of fun with that. I mostly 3D model now
- A fun fact about me is I enjoy bashing my head against the wall for fun.
- What do I want to learn from EE 205? How to improve my AI
- A book or movie I'd recommend is:  honestly, if i had filmed my life, id recommend watching that, but i didnt, so honestly thomas the tank engine. baller show. baller book series too. love it when they lock up an engine for falling off a cliff and then spend the next 10 years slowly cannibalizing him for spare parts while he's still technically alive
